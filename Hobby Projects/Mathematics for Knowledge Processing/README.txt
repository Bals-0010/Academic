Algebraic Structure
-------------------

Algebraic Structure is based on the properties of binary homogenous operations
 

This small program to create matrices to show
(Z,+) and (Z,*)
for identifying rings, isomorphisms etc

  
Defintion source:

-----------
How to Run:
-----------

Input: An integer 'x'  
Output: A matrix showing (Zx,+) and (Zx,*).

>python math.py

  
Enter the number: 4  
(Z4 ,+)  
    +(0, 1, 2, 3)  
0 [0, 1, 2, 3]  
1 [1, 2, 3, 0]  
2 [2, 3, 0, 1]  
3 [3, 0, 1, 2]

(Z4 ,*)  
    *(0, 1, 2, 3)  
0 [0, 0, 0, 0]  
1 [0, 1, 2, 3]  
2 [0, 2, 0, 2]  
3 [0, 3, 2, 1]

Note: 
-------
This code is made for fun to understand the concepts algebraic structure.
Sometimes small example can make us understand things clearly.
