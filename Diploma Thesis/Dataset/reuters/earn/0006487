Plc <BICC.L>, which earlier announced a 10 pct rise in 1986
pre-tax profits, said it was determined to achieve higher
levels of performance, quality and service to accelerate its
improvement in earnings.
    BICC said in a statement that sales in BICC Cables were
down on 1985 due to a sharp drop in demand for cable in the oil
and chemical industries after the oil price drop. But profits
in Balfour Beatty were substantially improved.
    Profits increased in BICC Technologies and in BICC
International in local currency terms, while Associated British
Cables had another excellent year, the company said.
    BICC shares were last quoted at 357p, up from 344p at
yesterday's close, in buoyant response to results which were
ahead of market expectations, dealers said.
    BICC pre-tax profits rose to 101 mln stg in 1986 from 92
mln in 1985, with turnover rising from 2.11 billion stg in 1985
to 2.14 billion stg in 1986.
